A RISC-V assembler written in Lisp. It will run under Common Lisp or my uLisp interpreter for microcontroller boards.

For more information see http://www.ulisp.com/show?310Z.

For a list of the RISC-V instructions supported by the assembler see: http://www.ulisp.com/show?30Z4.

For assembler examples see: http://www.ulisp.com/show?30ZU.

The file **RISC-V Assembler FP.lisp** contains optional floating-point extensions; for an example of their use see: http://forum.ulisp.com/t/mandelbrot-set-using-risc-v-assembler/522.
